Build a full-stack web application called Glimmer. Follow the exact requirements below to generate the complete MVP at once.

🛠 Tech Stack

Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS (romantic/cosmic theme in purple/blue hues, dark mode by default).

Animations & 3D Graphics:

Three.js → starfield universe (for Memory Orb) and animated 3D pet.

Framer Motion → smooth page transitions.

Backend: Node.js + Express.js.

Database: Google Cloud (Firestore or SQL-ready, use modular DB connection so it can be easily swapped).

Authentication: JWT (email + password login/signup).

Real-time Communication: Socket.io (for chats and multiplayer games).

AI Chatbot: integrate OpenAI API for in-app assistance.
